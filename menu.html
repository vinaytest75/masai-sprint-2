    <div>
        <div>Nigiri</div>
        <div>A topping, usually fish, served on top of sushi rice</div>
        <div>Not all nigiri is raw, though this dish is best for people who want to appreciate the flavor of the fish, shellfish, or other toppings</div>
        <div>3000$</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>Sashimi</div>
        <div>Fish or shellfish served alone (no rice)</div>
        <div>This is best for people who really love to taste the fish or shellfish since it comes with nothing else</div>
        <div>2000$</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>Maki</div>
        <div>Rice and filling wrapped in seaweed</div>
        <div>This is what most people think of when they think of sushi rolls</div>
        <div>1500$</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>Uramaki</div>
        <div>Similar to the above, but rice is on the outside and seaweed wraps around the filling</div>
        <div>These rolls often have lots of toppings and sauces â€” they may either be cooked or raw</div>
        <div>2000$</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>Temaki</div>
        <div>Sushi that has been hand-rolled into a cone shape</div>
        <div>The cones are not as easy to share as the rolls (though very delicious!)</div>
        <div>1000$</div>
    </div>
